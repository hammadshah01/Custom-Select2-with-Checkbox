ðŸ§© Custom MultiSelect Dropdown with Checkboxes, Search & Select-All (Vanilla JS)
This repository provides a lightweight and reusable custom multi-select dropdown component built with plain JavaScript, designed to mimic and enhance the functionality of plugins like Select2 â€” without any external dependencies.

ðŸ”¥ Features
âœ… Custom-designed dropdown with checkboxes
âœ… Integrated search box to filter options
âœ… Select All / Deselect All option
âœ… Bootstrap-compatible checkbox styling (form-check-input)
âœ… Dynamic display of selected count (e.g., Selected (2), Selected (All))
âœ… Supports multiple dropdowns on the same page
âœ… Fully accessible via form submission
âœ… Hides original <select> and keeps it in sync (non-destructive)

ðŸ“¦ How It Works
This custom component enhances any <select multiple> element that has the class customselect. The original select is hidden, and a styled wrapper with a search bar, checkboxes, and a custom dropdown UI is rendered in its place. The component stays fully in sync with the original <select>, so form submissions and backend integrations work as expected.

ðŸ“‹ Usage
Add the customselect class to your <select multiple>:

html
Copy
Edit
<select class="form-select customselect" multiple>
    <option value="1">Option One</option>
    <option value="2">Option Two</option>
</select>
Include the JS and optional styles from the repo in your Blade or HTML file.

ðŸ§  Example Behavior
Typing into the search bar filters the list of options.

Clicking "Select All" checks all boxes and marks all options as selected.

Selected items are shown as a count in the display (not tags), e.g.:

Select...

Selected (2)

Selected (All)

ðŸ’¡ Why Use This?
If you want a customizable, Bootstrap-compatible, and dependency-free alternative to Select2 for multi-select fields â€” especially in Laravel Blade or vanilla JS projects â€” this solution is lightweight, intuitive, and easily extendable.
